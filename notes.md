## Failure to capture topic evolution
Some topic might evolve over time

## Why not just use keywords?

1. might be too specific?

## Observed problems
- The learned topic model seems not very good


## Different generative models

For now, the standard LDA is used which assumes the same topic generation probability across all periods

Can we use *different topic generation probabilities* across different periods while imposing constraints on them?
