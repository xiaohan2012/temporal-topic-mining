We introduce the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a measure of non-linear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimension based on the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-RÃ©nyi Maximum Correlation Coefficient. RDC is defined in terms of correlation of random non-linear copula projections; it is invariant with respect to marginal distribution transformations, has low computational cost and is easy to implement: just five lines of R code, included at the end of the paper.
In text analysis documents are represented as disorganized bags of words, models of count features are typically based on mixing a small number of topics \cite{lda,sam}. Recently, it has been observed that for many text corpora documents evolve into one another in a smooth way, with some features dropping and new ones being introduced. The counting grid \cite{cgUai} models this spatial metaphor literally: it is multidimensional grid of word distributions learned in such a way that a document's own distribution of features can be modeled as the sum of the histograms found in a window into the grid. The major drawback of this method is that it is essentially a mixture and all the content much be generated by a single contiguous area on the grid. This may be problematic especially for lower dimensional grids. In this paper, we overcome to this issue with the \emph{Componential Counting Grid} which brings the componential nature of topic models to the basic counting grid. We also introduce a generative kernel based on the document's grid usage and a visualization strategy useful for understanding large text corpora. We evaluate our approach on document classification and multimodal retrieval obtaining state of the art results on standard benchmarks.
Psychophysical experiments have demonstrated that the brain integrates information from multiple sensory cues in a near Bayesian optimal manner. The present study proposes a novel mechanism to achieve this. We consider two reciprocally connected networks, mimicking the integration of heading direction information between the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas. Each network serves as a local estimator and receives an independent cue, either the visual or the vestibular, as direct input for the external stimulus. We find that positive reciprocal interactions can improve the decoding accuracy of each individual network as if it implements Bayesian inference from two cues. Our model successfully explains the experimental finding that both MSTd and VIP achieve Bayesian multisensory integration, though each of them only receives a single cue as direct external input. Our result suggests that the brain may implement optimal information integration distributively at each local estimator through the reciprocal connections between cortical regions.
